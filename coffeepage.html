           <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. 
               When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried.
               [3] Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. 
               Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

            Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
            [4] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[5] and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways 
            (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or 
            iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with 
            coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as 
            a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).</p>
            <p>Clinical research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a stimulant in healthy adults, 
                with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term 
                studies are of questionable credibility.[6]

                The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the 
                middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now 
                prepared for drinking.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries, 
                and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading 
                to Europe.
                
                The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries,
                 primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was 
                 the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[7] Coffee is a major export commodity as the leading legal 
                 agricultural export for numerous countries.[8] It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, 
                 unroasted coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.[9] The way developed countries trade coffee with 
                 developing nations has been criticised, as well as the impact on the environment with regards to the clearing of land for 
                 coffee-growing and water use. Consequently, the markets for fair trade and organic coffee are expanding.[10]</p>

           <p>A coffeemaker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee. While there are many different types of coffeemakers 
               using several different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter 
               inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family. Cold water is poured into 
               a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel. This is also called automatic drip-brew.</p>
               <p>For hundreds of years, making a cup of coffee was a simple process. Roasted and ground coffee beans were placed in a pot or pan, 
                   to which hot water was added and followed by the attachment of a lid to commence the infusion process. Pots were designed 
                   specifically for brewing coffee, all to try to trap the coffee grounds before the coffee is poured. Typical designs feature a 
                   pot with a flat expanded bottom to catch sinking grounds and a sharp pour spout that traps the floating grinds. Other designs 
                   feature a wide bulge in the middle of the pot to catch grounds when coffee is poured.

                In about 1889 the infusion brewing process was introduced in France. This involved immersing the ground coffee beans, usually 
                enclosed in a linen bag, in hot water and letting it steep or "infuse" until the desired strength brew was achieved. Nevertheless,
                 throughout the 19th and even the early 20th centuries, it was considered adequate to add ground coffee to hot water in a pot or 
                 pan, boil it until it smelled right, and pour the brew into a cup.</p>
